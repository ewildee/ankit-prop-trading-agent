# Changelog

All notable changes to this project. Newest first. Times are HH:MM 24-h **Europe/Amsterdam** (operator clock; this machine's local time). Service-runtime audit-log timestamps live in **Europe/Prague** (FTMO server clock) and are not the same axis.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-04-27 18:35 Europe/Amsterdam

**Initiated by:** FoundingEngineer (agent), executing ANKA-6.

**Why:** Phase 1 of the BLUEPRINT.md roadmap — `@triplon/proc-supervisor` is the lifecycle manager for the process tree (BLUEPRINT §3, §17, §22 phase 1, §23.3, §23.4). The exit gate is "`bun run start` brings up fake services with all transitions verified".

**Added** — `@triplon/proc-supervisor` v0.1.0 (`pkg:supervisor`)

- `topo-sort`: Kahn-style dependency-ordered startup with parallel waves; rejects cycles, unknown deps, duplicate names. Reverse-topo for shutdown ordering.
- `restart-policy`: backoff (exponential, capped) + circuit-break (`maxCrashes` in `windowMs` → `circuit-broken`, BLUEPRINT §23.4 default 3-in-5-min).
- `health-poller`: HTTP `/health` poll with abort-controller timeouts; validates the full `HealthSnapshot` schema; status-class gating (`expectStatus`).
- `findproc-adapter`: `lsof`-backed real adapter + injectable `FakeFindProc` for hermetic tests; POSIX signal delivery via `process.kill`.
- `process-manager`: per-service state machine (`idle | starting | running | unhealthy | stopping | stopped | crashed | circuit-broken | adopted`). Implements adopt | replace | refuse semantics on port collision; `Bun.spawn` for spawn; SIGTERM-then-SIGKILL graceful stop with shutdown-timeout backstop; ring-buffered stdout/stderr capture.
- `aggregated-health`: `Bun.serve` on `port` (default 9100). Routes `GET /health` → `AggregatedHealth`, `GET /services` → `ServiceStatus[]`, `POST /services/<name>/restart`, `GET /services/<name>/logs`, `DELETE /supervisor` (graceful shutdown handle).
- `config-loader`: `Bun.YAML.parse` → Zod-validated `SupervisorCfg`; cross-validates `dependsOn` references and self-loops.
- CLI (`pkg:supervisor/cli`): `start | stop | status | restart <name> | logs <name> | --version`. SIGTERM/SIGINT → reverse-topo graceful shutdown.
- Top-level `Supervisor` orchestrator: parallel-wave start, reverse-topo stop, owns health-server lifecycle.

**Added** — `@ankit-prop/contracts` v0.1.0 (`pkg:contracts/health`)

- `HealthSnapshot` Zod schema (BLUEPRINT §19.0) — strict-object validation, every service uses this for `/health`.
- `AggregatedHealth`, `ServiceStatus`, `SUPERVISOR_SERVICE_STATES` schemas/enums for the supervisor's aggregator (BLUEPRINT §19.0.1).
- `loadVersionFromPkgJson` helper — runtime-load the `version` field from `package.json` so `/health` always reflects the actually-running build (no hard-coded version strings, BLUEPRINT §19.0).

**Tested**

- 8 unit suites: `topoSort`, `RestartPolicy`, `parseConfig`, `pollOnce` + `waitUntilHealthy`, `FakeFindProc`, `buildAggregatedHealth`, `HealthSnapshot` / `AggregatedHealth` / `loadVersionFromPkgJson`.
- 7 integration cases against the in-repo `fake-service` (BLUEPRINT §22 phase 1 exit gate): adopt, replace, refuse, restart-policy, topo-order, circuit-break, graceful shutdown — including aggregated `/health` round-trip.
- 45 tests / 79 expect() calls / 0 fails (`bun test` in 3.4 s on this host).

**Notes**

- `zod@4.3.6` (BLUEPRINT §5.2 pin) added to root + workspace `dependencies`. Bun built-ins used everywhere else (`Bun.spawn`, `Bun.serve`, `Bun.YAML.parse`, `Bun.file`, `Bun.env`, `bun:test`) per BLUEPRINT §5.1.
- `SupervisorCfg` is `loose()` at the top level so `config/supervisor.example.yaml` can carry future `recovery:` / `daily_summary:` / `operator:` blocks without breaking the supervisor loader. `ServiceCfg` stays strict.
- The 14 hard rails are out of scope for Phase 1 — they belong to `svc:gateway` (Phase 2, ANKA-7).
- This release also picks up the root-version bump that ANKA-10 (v0.0.3) explicitly deferred to "the Phase 1 (T002) session".

## 0.0.3 — 2026-04-27 18:31 Europe/Amsterdam

**Initiated by:** FoundingEngineer (agent), executing ANKA-10 (parent
ANKA-9) under CEO direction.

**Why:** Replace the IC Markets demo with the FTMO Free Trial as the
Phase 2 smoke-test target and the Phase 6.5 burn-in surface. The Free
Trial is free, gives us real broker data immediately, is
operator-resettable when guardrails trip, and aligns the smoke-test
environment with the eventual paid-challenge surface — pulling a real
broker integration onto the critical path much faster.

**Changed**

- `BLUEPRINT.md` — §0.1 onboarding interview, §10.3 (`ctrader-ts`
  smoke), §14 sim slippage calibration source, §21.1 / §21.3 / §21.7
  test pyramid + integration matrix, §22 phase table (Phase 2 / 4 /
  6.5), §24.1 / §24.2 / §24.3 pre-launch checklists, §26 open
  questions: every "IC Markets demo" / "IC demo" reference retargeted
  to "FTMO Free Trial". Paid FTMO 100k 2-step entry untouched.
- `.env.example` — `BROKER_*_IC_DEMO_1` → `BROKER_*_FTMO_TRIAL_1`;
  cTrader-app comment now points at the trial; `BROKER_*_FTMO_1`
  block kept verbatim for the future paid challenge.
- `config/accounts.example.yaml` — account `ic-demo-1` →
  `ftmo-trial-1`; `broker.provider` `ctrader-ic-demo` →
  `ctrader-ftmo-trial`; envelope `ic-demo-burn-in` →
  `ftmo-trial-burn-in`; commented that the slot is operator-resettable.
- `README.md` — operating-contract bullet now says "FTMO Free Trial
  demo and FTMO challenge demo only".
- `TODOS.md` — T005 + T011 retargeted.

**Notes**

- ANKA-5 onboarding intake to be retargeted in the same heartbeat:
  cancel the in-flight `ask_user_questions` interaction (which still
  asks IC Markets demo fields) and repost with FTMO Free Trial fields.
  Cross-link comment posted on ANKA-5.
- No changes to risk numerics, hard rails, or pipeline content.
- No live broker calls in this commit. `bun run lint` + `bun run
  typecheck` pass against the working tree (Phase 1 in-flight changes
  also present and untouched).
- Root package version bump intentionally deferred — `package.json` is
  in-flight in the Phase 1 (T002) session and will be bumped there.

## 0.0.2 — 2026-04-27 18:21 Europe/Amsterdam

**Initiated by:** FoundingEngineer (agent), executing ANKA-5.

**Why:** BLUEPRINT §0.1 onboarding scaffold. Make the credential/config
intake reproducible from blank slate so the operator can populate `.env`
once and the build continues autonomously.

**Added**

- `.env.example` rewritten as the canonical §17.5 + §0.1 template — covers
  cTrader app creds, IC demo account, FTMO slot, OpenRouter, alerting,
  telemetry, encryption key, and operating mode.
- `config/accounts.example.yaml` — committed editable template for
  BLUEPRINT §17.1 with `*_env` references only (zero inlined secrets).
- `config/supervisor.example.yaml` — committed §17.2 template (services,
  recovery, daily summary, operator block).
- `~/.config/ankit-prop/accounts.config.yaml` and
  `~/.config/ankit-prop/supervisor.config.yaml` — operator-canonical
  copies written to host scope (gitignored).
- Local `.env` seeded with a freshly generated `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
  (32-byte hex via `crypto.randomBytes`); other fields blank for operator
  to drop secrets in.

**Notes**

- `.env` and host `*.config.yaml` are gitignored; `config/*.example.yaml`
  is whitelisted. Verified via `git check-ignore`.
- OpenRouter health probe and cTrader `application_auth` OAuth check
  remain pending — they require operator-supplied secrets and run as
  part of the `ask_user_questions` follow-up on ANKA-5.

## 0.0.1 — 2026-04-27 18:16 Europe/Amsterdam

**Initiated by:** FoundingEngineer (agent), executing ANKA-2.

**Why:** Phase 0 of the BLUEPRINT.md roadmap — produce a working umbrella monorepo skeleton so subsequent phases (proc-supervisor, ctrader-gateway, …) have a stable, lintable, testable, version-tracked surface to land on.

**Added**

- Bun workspaces (`packages/*`, `services/*`) with placeholder package.json in each member.
- Pinned dev surface: Bun 1.3.13 (engines), Biome 2.4.13, TypeScript 6.0.3.
- Root scripts: `start`, `stop`, `status`, `lint`, `lint:fix`, `typecheck`, `test`, `db:migrate`, `backup`, `restore`, `secrets:rotate`.
- `tsconfig.json` (strict, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, bundler resolution, `bun` types).
- `biome.json`, `bunfig.toml`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example` per BLUEPRINT §17.5.
- `.dev/` skeleton: `progress.md`, `journal.md`, `decisions.md` (ADR-0001, ADR-0002), `ideas/`, `discussion/`, `specs/`.
- Seed `TODOS.md` covering the BLUEPRINT phasing.
- Smoke spec in `packages/shared-contracts/` so `bun test` has at least one assertion to run.
- GitHub Actions CI gate (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint + typecheck + test.

**Notes**

- No business code in this release — Phase 0 is intentionally a skeleton, per ADR-0001.
